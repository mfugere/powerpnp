# powerpnp
PowerPNP is a canvas for dynamic roleplaying experiences, where the Game Master is in control of their campaign from setup to running live sessions with their players. Never has online tabletop gaming been so fluid yet full-featured. This is the most fun you'll have outside of your parents' basement!
